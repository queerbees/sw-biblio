> "...we need careful social and humanistic studies of science. In the high-stakesw orld of contemporarys cience, the Sokal hoax is too trivial to merit scholarly attention (except insofar as it can serve as a model system for studying more general processes). But the charge of triviality does not apply to research on the formation of collective judgments about knowledge claims that concern, for example, global climate change, computer network security, or the efficacy of mammography.

> "When viewed in light of related episodes, the Sokal affair looks less like a dramaticd emonstrationth ana n absurdf arce.S okal, a newcomert o the field of STS, endorses central research questions in the field without recognizing this. He makes undisciplined arguments in the name of upholding scholarly standards. He achieves considerable success in the public arena, but this outcome cannot be explained by the methodological strength of his evidence; instead, the reception of his experiment represents precisely the kind of phenomenon that can only be illuminated through careful studies of the social and cultural aspects of science. In short, when the episode is considered in context, the meaning of the Sokal affair is completely recast, Sokal has produced a parody not only of cultural studies but also a parody of himself." {{ cite hilgartner1997 }}
